   <title>The Watershed Warrior</title>
   <hr>
 
	<p>Work In Progress!

	<p>The year is 2019, and Tim Burr suits up for a long day of work. For he is the protector of all within the Watershed. 
	Tim is the latest in the long line of protectors. He knew that he would one day pick up the mantle of Protector from the moment he was born. 
	For the Burr family has protected the Watershed since its creation.</p>

	<p>The Watershed is a sacred place, for it houses the most prestigious houses, the best job opportunities, and boasts the lowest utilities prices.
	The people within the Watershed are kind souls, and it's said that the people within the Watershed never get sick, and have reduced stress levels.</p>

	<p>It is because of this evil goers try to harm the Watershed. They are jealous of what the Watershed holds, and wish to take it for themselves.
	These outsiders come in waves. They come bearing bacteria to pollute the water, and even fire to burn down the green life.</p>
